!! now its is not a procedural danmaku game !!
!! dungeons now mean the story part of game !!
!! maybe i'll even rename this game !!


- player power ups

- level system
- scenes? so we can plan bots creation as in Touhou levels? 
- key movement for enemies
- some kind of redactor of levels 


To be kind of consistent (for now) with speed of game without 
delta time I will just use Vsync, even if it could be working poorly.

# Level designer and editor

- paths for bots to go (linear lines through the screen)

# level system should work in logic of midi events

instead of ppm we will use 60 updates per second and will execute 
command when counter of game and event time will be equal. Basically
we read input commands until we hit command that is higher than
current counter. 

How will replay work while editing?

As in midi sequencers. If you start after "midi note on" effect,
you wont hear note. 

For example I should have these events:
* Spawn event 
    at_time
    entity_id

    position
* move_to_point event // it could generate a bunch of events every frame! but with that we can just simply record player input BTW
    at_time
    entity_id
    to_position

* despawn event
    at_time
    entity_id

- playback in speed and so on

- power up consuption.
