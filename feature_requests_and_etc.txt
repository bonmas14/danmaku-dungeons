Only english in window title:
    Probably because of WindowOpenEx (Wide char versions is WindowOpenExW)
    Maybe it should be Wide char version? But it's not that required. 
    Because different languages work in game. 

Feature requests:
* playback speed for audio players
    by: resampling
    to: pitch
* audio_reset_progression

* audio_is_finished (progression == 1)
    but not a new state in player, because its very neat 
    to just reset progression and it plays
